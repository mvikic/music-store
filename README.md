Python console application for a musical instruments store 
=======

Getting started
------

Open a command prompt window with the cwd set to the path of the project files.

Creat an user account with option (1). Then log on to that user account using the before created credentials.
Three account roles are available: buyer (kupac), seller (prodavac) and manager (menad≈æer). 
A buyer account can be created directly using the console. The manager creates an account for the seller, and the manager role is set up in the korisnici.txt file.
